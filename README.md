# homeAutomationPanel

Simple automation panel, in my room, IoT stuff.
Panel let's you to turn on and off some devices in your room or somewhere in your home.

Panel is a resistive touchscreen which size is 3.5" produced by Adafruit. And works on Rasbian Scretch, RPi Zero.

## HARDWARE
  Adafruit 3.5" TFT + Resistive Touch Screen https://www.adafruit.com/product/2097
  Raspberry Pi Zero W https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/
  
## TRICKS
  Remove the Rasbian's built-in graphic interface, and install more basic one. (In my case my RPi burnt itself. You can think about cooler fan.)
